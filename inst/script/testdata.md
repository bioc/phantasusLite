`inst/extdata/testdata/gct` folder contains toy gene expression files in GCT format, generated for testing purposes. They are generated based on a small subset of GSE63040 and GSE53986 datasets. The initial versions of the files were obtained by exporting the corresponding datasets from Phantasus application. Additionally, files were manually modified to trigger certain code scenarios (e.g. by introducing duplicated IDs in `test_dup.gct`).
